				<h2>Ingredients: Makes 4-5 Sandwiches</h2>
			
				<article>
					<h3>For Slow Cooker Pulled Lamb:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 - 2 lbs boneless leg of lamb</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">3/4 chicken stock</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 teaspoon rosemary</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 tablespoon olive oil</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">2 cloves of garlic (smashed)</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 teaspoon cracked black pepper</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</input></li>
					</ul>
				</article>

					<h3>For Caramelized Onion: (Slow Cooker version in "The Book")</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">4 cups thinly sliced</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 teaspoon salt</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</input></li>
					</ul>
				</article>

					<h3>For the Chipotle Garlic Aioli: Makes 1 cup</h3>
					<span>I followed this recipe for garlic aioli on David Lebovitz's blog, tweaked just a little. Just omit the garlic from this recipe and add chipotle garlic paste instead.</span>

					<ul>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">2 tablespoons Chipotle and Roasted Garlic Paste</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1/2 tsp salt</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1 large egg yolk, at room temperature</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1/2 cup (250ml) extra-virgin olive oil</input></li>
						<li class="list"><input type="checkbox">1/2 cup pure olive oil</input></li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				

				<span>You'd be surprised to notice that I use two kinds of olive oils. I once read a chef  mixing half of pure live oil to the quantity of extra virgin olive oil to cut on the strong taste of oil in the aioli. I tried and it works for me. If you'd rather use 1 cup extra virgin then go ahead. You will not be breaking any rules.</span>
				

				<h3><em>Remaining ingredients I used for the sandwich. You can always play around here!
				Baguette bread (you can use your choice of hard crusted bread)</em></h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Some greens (arugula or baby spinach go well with this)</li>
					<li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
					<li>Sliced avacado</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Method:</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>Preparing Lamb: </h3>
					<span>In a mason jar add all the ingredients except for the lamb and chicken stock. Close the lid and shake vigorously for 5 seconds. (This is how I make my vinaigrette) 
					Pour the vinaigrette to a ziplock bag. Add the lamb. Seal the bag and squish it so that all the vinaigrette is coated well around the lamb. Let it sit for 30 minutes.
					Take the lamb out of the Ziplock back. Heat a cast iron skillet. Transfer the lamb to the skillet and cook on each side for 3-4 minutes.</span>

					<span>Pour chicken stock to the slow cooker. Transfer the lamb to the slow cooker discarding all excess fat.</span>

					<span>Cover and cook on low for low for 6-7 hours.</span>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h3>For Caramelized Onion:</h3> 
					<span>Use a wide thick bottom saute pan (I use a cast iron skillet). Heat oil/butter
					Add sliced onion. Stir well to coat the onion with oil/butter. Turn the heat to medium and let it cook on its own, stirring occasionally.</span>

					<span>As the onion turns brown and looses its water it will stick to the bottom. Let it stick a little but keep an eye so that you do not burn them and keep stirring occasionally. 
					Towards the end the onions might all come together and begin to stick more to the bottom. Try adding a couple tablespoons of water to deglaze the pan. Turn the heat off and let it sit in the hot pan for 10 minutes before you move it to dish.</span>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h3>For the Aioli:</h3>
					<span>I followed the recipe as on David's blog. Its explained well there and always works for me. Just substitute garlic with Chipotle and Roasted Garlic Paste.</span>	
				</article>

				</article>
					<h3>Putting the sandwich together:</h3>
					<span>Take the leg of lamb out of the slow cooker. Using two forks shred the meat. I always reduce the remaining liquid in the slow cooker and pour it over my meat. So I did the same here.</span>
					
					<span>On a bed of greens over sliced baguette put some pulled leg of lamb, add caramelized onion, tomato and avacado. Smother some aioli on the other half of the baguette. Place it on top and enjoy with a glass of cold beer and your honey!</span>

					<span class="text-bio">I was born in a small town of central India and grew up in a few more small towns of India. Then I met this guy whom I now call husband, married him and moved to the US . Later came this angel in our lives who has been keeping us on our toes ever since and making our lives worth every breath! When I'm not running behind her then I'm either in my kitchen developing, testing and retesting a recipe or I'm playing around with my camera in my garage turned studio. Three things made me this awesome cook (sarcasm!) that I am today.. circumstances, no help and hunger!! </span>
